## My First Experience with React
I've done some basic web work in the past, generally with Wordpress.  So the JavaScript work I've done has been pretty limited to vanilla JavaScript and jQuery.  

There was really no rime or reason as to why I picked React first.  It just seemed like the most interesting from what little I knew about the top JavaScript frameworks.  Throughout this experience I'm hoping to tinker and play with a few JavaScript frameworks as well as other more web-based frameworks.  At the moment I'm planning on React (clearly), Angular, Vue.js and Blazor.

Anywho - let's cut to the chase.

I figured that there probably wasn't a much better place to start than the [official React website's tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).  If you don't know (or haven't clicked that link), this tutorial is to create a simple game of tic-tac-toe.

The tutorial starts by walking you through basic component creation and state management.  As the tutorial progresses, it teaches you about promoting state management to parent components, handling and tracking user input, as well as determining a winner.

All in all, I found the tutorial pretty easy to follow and generally informative, although I know it was a very basic beginning and just scratching the surface of React.

Feel free to check out my completed version of the tutorial [here](https://mcbtay.github.io/react-tutorial).  This includes implementations for all of the suggested enhancements at the end of the tutorial as well!
